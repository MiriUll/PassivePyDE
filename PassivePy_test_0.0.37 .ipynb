Methods and findings A sample of 312 patients with heart failure and 312 of their nearest relatives were included in the study. The Family Functioning, Health and Social Support questionnaire was used to collect the data. Dyadic data were analysed by the Actor Partner Interdependence Mediation Model with distinguishable dyads using structural equation modelling. Patients and nearest relatives who perceived more social support had a higher level of family health and functioned better within the family. One partner effect was found, indicating that the higher the level of family health of the nearest relative, the better the family functioning of the patient (p 0.001). Family health partially (in the patient) and completely (in the nearest relative) mediated the association between social support and family functioning. This study indicated that patients with heart failure and their nearest relatives who perceived more social support from nurses were more likely to have high level of family health and function better within the family. The interdependent relationships found in our study highlight a dyadic and family-oriented approach to improve family functioning in patients with heart failure.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>[were included, was used, were analysed, was found]</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>11</td>\n","      <td>0.363636</td>\n","      <td>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217970</td>\n","      <td>Dyadic effects of perceived social support on family health and family functioning in patients with heart failure and their nearest relatives: Using the Actor–Partner Interdependence Mediation Model</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>46</th>\n","      <td>Socially disadvantaged people have an increased need for medical care due to a higher burden of health problems and chronic diseases. In Germany, outpatient care is chiefly provided by office-based general practitioners and specialists in private practice. People are free to choose the physician they prefer. In this study, national data were used to examine differences in the use of outpatient medical care by socioeconomic status (SES). Methods The analyses were based on data from 6,754 participants in the Robert Koch Institute German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) aged between 18 and 69 years. The number of outpatient physician visits during the past twelve months was assessed for several medical specializations. SES was determined based on education, occupation, and income. Associations between SES and physician visits were analysed using logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression for count data. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health indicators, outpatients with low SES had more contacts with general practitioners than outpatients with high SES (men incidence rate ratio IRR 1.25 95 confidence interval CI 1.08 1.46 women IRR 1.20 95 CI 1.07 1.34). The use of specialists was lower in people with low SES than in those with high SES when sociodemographic factors and health indicators were adjusted for (men odds ratio OR 0.68 95 CI 0.51 0.91 women OR 0.56 95 CI 0.41 0.77). This applied particularly to specialists in internal medicine, dermatology, and gynaecology. The associations remained after additional adjustment for the type of health insurance and the regional density of office-based physicians. The findings suggest that socially disadvantaged people are seen by general practitioners more often than the socially better-off, who are more likely to visit a medical specialist. These differences may be due to differences in patient preferences, physician factors, physician-patient interaction, and potential barriers to accessing specialist care.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>[is chiefly provided, were used, was assessed, was determined, were analysed, were adjusted, are seen]</td>\n","      <td>7</td>\n","      <td>7</td>\n","      <td>14</td>\n","      <td>0.5</td>\n","      <td>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155982</td>\n","      <td>Socioeconomic Status and Use of Outpatient Medical Care: The Case of Germany</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>47</th>\n","      <td>Societies are facing medical resource scarcities, inter alia due to increased life expectancy and limited health budgets and also due to temporal or continuous physical shortages of resources like donor organs. This makes it challenging to meet the medical needs of all. Ethicists provide normative guidance for how to fairly allocate scarce medical resources, but legitimate decisions require additionally information regarding what the general public considers to be fair. The purpose of this study was to explore how lay people, general practitioners, medical students and other health professionals evaluate the fairness of ten allocation principles for scarce medical resources sickest first , waiting list , prognosis , behaviour (i.e., those who engage in risky behaviour should not be prioritized), instrumental value (e.g., health care workers should be favoured during epidemics), combination of criteria (i.e., a sequence of the youngest first , prognosis , and lottery principles), reciprocity (i.e., those who provided services to the society in the past should be rewarded), youngest first , lottery , and monetary contribution . Methods 1,267 respondents to an online questionnaire were confronted with hypothetical situations of scarcity regarding donor organs, hospital beds during an epidemic, and joint replacements. Nine allocation principles were evaluated in terms of fairness for each type of scarcity along 7-point Likert scales. The relationship between demographic factors (gender, age, religiosity, political orientation, and health status) and fairness evaluations was modelled with logistic regression. Medical background was a major predictor of fairness evaluations. While general practitioners showed different response patterns for all three allocation situations, the responses by lay people were very similar. Lay people rated sickest first and waiting list on top of all allocation principles e.g., for donor organs 83.8 (95 CI 81.2 86.2 ) rated sickest first as fair ( fair is represented by scale points 5 7), and 69.5 66.2 72.4 rated waiting list as fair. The corresponding results for general practitioners prognosis 79.7 74.2 84.9 , combination of criteria 72.6 66.4 78.5 , and sickest first 74.5 68.6 80.1 ) these were the highest-rated allocation principles for donor organs allocation. Interestingly, only 44.3 37.7 50.9 of the general practitioners rated instrumental value as fair for the allocation of hospital beds during a flu epidemic. The fairness evaluations by general practitioners obtained for joint replacements sickest first 84.0 78.8 88.6 , combination of criteria 65.6 59.2 71.8 , and prognosis 63.7 57.1 70.0 . Lottery , reciprocity , instrumental value , and monetary contribution were considered very unfair allocation principles by both groups. Medical students ratings were similar to those of general practitioners, and the ratings by other health professionals resembled those of lay people. are partly at odds with current conclusions proposed by some ethicists. A number of ethicists reject sickest first and waiting list as morally unjustifiable allocation principles, whereas those allocation principles received the highest fairness endorsements by lay people and to some extent also by health professionals. Decision makers are advised to consider whether or not to give ethicists, health professionals, and the general public an equal voice when attempting to arrive at maximally endorsed allocations of scarce medical resources.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>[be prioritized, be favoured, be rewarded, were confronted, were evaluated, was modelled, is represented, were considered, are advised]</td>\n","      <td>9</td>\n","      <td>7</td>\n","      <td>17</td>\n","      <td>0.411765</td>\n","      <td>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159086</td>\n","      <td>How to Fairly Allocate Scarce Medical Resources: Ethical Argumentation under Scrutiny by Health Professionals and Lay People</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>48</th>\n","      <td>Socioeconomic disadvantage (SED) has been consistently associated with early life mental health problems. SED has been shown to impact multiple biological systems, including the regulation of neurotrophic proteins, immune-inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, which, conversely, have been reported to be relevant to physiological and pathological neurodevelopment This study investigated the relationship between SED, different domains of psychopathology, serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL6), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We hypothesized that a composite of socioeconomic risk would be associated with psychopathology and altered levels of peripheral biomarkers. In addition, we hypothesized that SED would moderate the associations between mental health problems, IL6, TBARS and BDNF. Using a cross-sectional design, we measured the serum levels of IL6, TBARS and BDNF in 495 children aged 6 to 12. We also investigated socio-demographic characteristics and mental health problems using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) DSM-oriented scales. SED was evaluated using a cumulative risk model. Generalized linear models were used to assess associations between SED, biomarkers levels and psychopathology. SED was significantly associated with serum levels of IL6 (RR 1.026, 95 CI 1.004 1.049, 0.020) and TBARS (RR 1.077, 95 CI 1.028 1.127, 0.002). The association between SED and BDNF was not statistically significant (RR 1.031, 95 CI 0.997 1.066, 0.077). SED was also significantly associated with all CBCL DSM-oriented scales (all 0.05), whereas serum biomarkers (i.e. IL6, TBARS, BDNF) were associated with specific subscales. Moreover, the associations between serum biomarkers and domains of psychopathology were moderated by SED, with stronger correlations between mental health problems, IL6, TBARS, and BDNF being observed in children with high SED. In children, SED is highly associated with mental health problems. Our findings suggest that this association may be moderated via effects on multiple interacting neurobiological systems.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>[been shown, been reported, was evaluated, were used, were moderated, being observed, be moderated]</td>\n","      <td>7</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>15</td>\n","      <td>0.333333</td>\n","      <td>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160455</td>\n","      <td>Socioeconomic Disadvantage Moderates the Association between Peripheral Biomarkers and Childhood Psychopathology</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>49</th>\n","      <td>Socioeconomic disadvantage and other social stressors in childhood have been linked with cardiometabolic diseases in adulthood however the mechanisms underlying these observed associations and the timing of their emergence are unclear.

Methods We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science to identify relevant publications between 2001 and 2013.Studies were selected based on 4 criteria (1) the study examined an association between at least one social or economic stressor and one relevant outcome prior to age 21 (2) the sample originated from a high-income country (3) the sample was not selected based on a health condition and (4) a central aim was to evaluate the effect of the social or economic stressor on at least one relevant outcome. were screened and relevant publications were obtained and evaluated for inclusion criteria. We abstracted data from selected articles, summarized them by exposures and outcomes, and assigned an evidence grade. Our search identified 37 publications from 31 studies. Socioeconomic disadvantage was consistently associated with greater central adiposity. Research to date does not provide clear evidence of an association between childhood stressors and lipids or carbohydrate metabolism-related factors. This review demonstrates a paucity of research on the relationship of socioeconomic disadvantage and other social stressors to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism-related factors in youth. Accordingly, it is not possible to form strong conclusions, particularly with regard to stressors other than socioeconomic disadvantage. Findings are used to inform priorities for future research. An improved understanding of these pathways is critical for identifying novel prevention targets and intervention opportunities to protect the long-term health of children and adolescents.</td>\n","

elements in the treatment of heart failure, yet most heart failure studies focus on the pharmacological interventions. This study aimed to examine whether perceived social support from nurses is associated with better family functioning of patients with heart failure and their nearest relatives and to examine whether family health mediates this relationship. Methods and findings A sample of 312 patients with heart failure and 312 of their nearest relatives were included in the study. The Family Functioning, Health and Social Support questionnaire was used to collect the data. Dyadic data were analysed by the Actor Partner Interdependence Mediation Model with distinguishable dyads using structural equation modelling. Patients and nearest relatives who perceived more social support had a higher level of family health and functioned better within the family. One partner effect was found, indicating that the higher the level of family health of the nearest relative, the better the family functioning of the patient (p 0.001). Family health partially (in the patient) and completely (in the nearest relative) mediated the association between social support and family functioning. This study indicated that patients with heart failure and their nearest relatives who perceived more social support from nurses were more likely to have high level of family health and function better within the family. The interdependent relationships found in our study highlight a dyadic and family-oriented approach to improve family functioning in patients with heart failure.  ...

In Germany, outpatient care is chiefly provided by office-based general practitioners and specialists in private practice. People are free to choose the physician they prefer. In this study, national data were used to examine differences in the use of outpatient medical care by socioeconomic status (SES). Methods The analyses were based on data from 6,754 participants in the Robert Koch Institute German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) aged between 18 and 69 years. The number of outpatient physician visits during the past twelve months was assessed for several medical specializations. SES was determined based on education, occupation, and income. Associations between SES and physician visits were analysed using logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression for count data. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health indicators, outpatients with low SES had more contacts with general practitioners than outpatients with high SES (men incidence rate ratio IRR 1.25 95 confidence interval CI 1.08 1.46 women IRR 1.20 95 CI 1.07 1.34). The use of specialists was lower in people with low SES than in those with high SES when sociodemographic factors and health indicators were adjusted for (men odds ratio OR 0.68 95 CI 0.51 0.91 women OR 0.56 95 CI 0.41 0.77). This applied particularly to specialists in internal medicine, dermatology, and gynaecology. The associations remained after additional adjustment for the type of health insurance and the regional density of office-based physicians. The findings suggest that socially disadvantaged people are seen by general practitioners more often than the socially better-off, who are more likely to visit a medical specialist. These differences may be due to differences in patient preferences, physician factors, physician-patient interaction, and potential barriers to accessing specialist care.  ...                                                                                                                            Socioeconomic Status and Use of Outpatient Medical Care: The Case of Germany\n","47   Societies are facing medical resource scarcities, inter alia due to increased life expectancy and limited health budgets and also due to temporal or continuous physical shortages of resources like donor organs. This makes it challenging to meet the medical needs of all. Ethicists provide normative guidance for how to fairly allocate scarce medical resources, but legitimate decisions require additionally information regarding what the general public considers to be fair. The purpose of this study was to explore how lay people, general practitioners, medical students and other health professionals evaluate the fairness of ten allocation principles for scarce medical resources sickest first , waiting list , prognosis , behaviour (i.e., those who engage in risky behaviour should not be prioritized), instrumental value (e.g., health care workers should be favoured during epidemics), combination of criteria (i.e., a sequence of the youngest first , prognosis , and lottery principles), reciprocity (i.e., those who provided services to the society in the past should be rewarded), youngest first , lottery , and monetary contribution . Methods 1,267 respondents to an online questionnaire were confronted with hypothetical situations of scarcity regarding donor organs, hospital beds during an epidemic, and joint replacements. Nine allocation principles were evaluated in terms of fairness for each type of scarcity along 7-point Likert scales. The relationship between demographic factors (gender, age, religiosity, political orientation, and health status) and fairness evaluations was modelled with logistic regression. Medical background was a major predictor of fairness evaluations. While general practitioners showed different response patterns for all three allocation situations, the responses by lay people were very similar. Lay people rated sickest first and waiting list on top of all allocation principles e.g., for donor organs 83.8 (95 CI 81.2 86.2 ) rated sickest first as fair ( fair is represented by scale points 5 7), and 69.5 66.2 72.4 rated waiting list as fair. The corresponding results for general practitioners prognosis 79.7 74.2 84.9 , combination of criteria 72.6 66.4 78.5 , and sickest first 74.5 68.6 80.1 ) these were the highest-rated allocation principles for donor organs allocation. Interestingly, only 44.3 37.7 50.9 of the general practitioners rated instrumental value as fair for the allocation of hospital beds during a flu epidemic. The fairness evaluations by general practitioners obtained for joint replacements sickest first 84.0 78.8 88.6 , combination of criteria 65.6 59.2 71.8 , and prognosis 63.7 57.1 70.0 . Lottery , reciprocity , instrumental value , and monetary contribution were considered very unfair allocation principles by both groups. Medical students ratings were similar to those of general practitioners, and the ratings by other health professionals resembled those of lay people. are partly at odds with current conclusions proposed by some ethicists. A number of ethicists reject sickest first and waiting list as morally unjustifiable allocation principles, whereas those allocation principles received the highest fairness endorsements by lay people and to some extent also by health professionals. Decision makers are advised to consider whether or not to give ethicists, health professionals, and the general public an equal voice when attempting to arrive at maximally endorsed allocations of scarce medical resources.  ...

SED has been shown to impact multiple biological systems, including the regulation of neurotrophic proteins, immune-inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, which, conversely, have been reported to be relevant to physiological and pathological neurodevelopment This study investigated the relationship between SED, different domains of psychopathology, serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL6), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We hypothesized that a composite of socioeconomic risk would be associated with psychopathology and altered levels of peripheral biomarkers. In addition, we hypothesized that SED would moderate the associations between mental health problems, IL6, TBARS and BDNF. Using a cross-sectional design, we measured the serum levels of IL6, TBARS and BDNF in 495 children aged 6 to 12. We also investigated socio-demographic characteristics and mental health problems using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) DSM-oriented scales. SED was evaluated using a cumulative risk model. Generalized linear models were used to assess associations between SED, biomarkers levels and psychopathology. SED was significantly associated with serum levels of IL6 (RR 1.026, 95 CI 1.004 1.049, 0.020) and TBARS (RR 1.077, 95 CI 1.028 1.127, 0.002). The association between SED and BDNF was not statistically significant (RR 1.031, 95 CI 0.997 1.066, 0.077). SED was also significantly associated with all CBCL DSM-oriented scales (all 0.05), whereas serum biomarkers (i.e. IL6, TBARS, BDNF) were associated with specific subscales. Moreover, the associations between serum biomarkers and domains of psychopathology were moderated by SED, with stronger correlations between mental health problems, IL6, TBARS, and BDNF being observed in children with high SED. In children, SED is highly associated with mental health problems. Our findings suggest that this association may be moderated via effects on multiple interacting neurobiological systems.  ...

The aim of this review was to evaluate research that examined relationships between socioeconomic disadvantage and other social stressors in relation to less-studied cardiometabolic risk factors among youth, including carbohydrate metabolism-related factors, lipids, and central adiposity. Methods We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science to identify relevant publications between 2001 and 2013.Studies were selected based on 4 criteria (1) the study examined an association between at least one social or economic stressor and one relevant outcome prior to age 21 (2) the sample originated from a high-income country (3) the sample was not selected based on a health condition and (4) a central aim was to evaluate the effect of the social or economic stressor on at least one relevant outcome. were screened and relevant publications were obtained and evaluated for inclusion criteria. We abstracted data from selected articles, summarized them by exposures and outcomes, and assigned an evidence grade. Our search identified 37 publications from 31 studies. Socioeconomic disadvantage was consistently associated with greater central adiposity. Research to date does not provide clear evidence of an association between childhood stressors and lipids or carbohydrate metabolism-related factors. This review demonstrates a paucity of research on the relationship of socioeconomic disadvantage and other social stressors to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism-related factors in youth. Accordingly, it is not possible to form strong conclusions, particularly with regard to stressors other than socioeconomic disadvantage. Findings are used to inform priorities for future research. An improved understanding of these pathways is critical for identifying novel prevention targets and intervention opportunities to protect the long-term health of children and adolescents.  ...
